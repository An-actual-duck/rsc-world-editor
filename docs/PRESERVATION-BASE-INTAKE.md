# Preservation source intake boundary

The compiled `preservation-source-jag-v1` discovery adapter admits the reviewed
public c0102e source layout, its JAG/MEM map inputs, and supported effective
configuration. A target-supplied descriptor does not grant this authority.
Changed source/build behavior, unknown files, unsafe paths, and untranslated
configuration remain blockers. Historical code is never built or executed.

The `preservation-c0102e-private-inputs-v1` policy binds metadata for these exact
external inputs, including explicit optional absence:

- Required: `server/inc/sqlite/preservation.db`, `server/server.pem`, and
  `server/client.pem`. Existing owner keys must form a valid matching pair;
  intake never generates replacement owner keys.
- Optional: `server/badwords.txt`, `server/goodwords.txt`,
  `server/alertwords.txt`, `server/ipbans.txt`, `server/ipbans.temp`, and
  `Client_Base/clientSettings.conf`.

These bytes are excluded from discovery's project-copy inventory. The private
binding records paths, roles, presence, size and SHA-256 only. Database/key/client
preferences require mode 0600; text filters and bans permit 0600 or 0644.
Symlinks, hard-link aliases, non-regular entries and unclosed SQLite sidecars
are refused. Bounds are 4 GiB for SQLite, 64 KiB per key and 1 MiB per other file.
Later client UID/remembered-credential layouts are not silently classified as
historical c0102e state.

A closed SQLite header is not schema validation. Production migration preview
records `schemaValidation: pending-provider-sealed-migration`, sets
`sqliteSchemaMigrationReady: false`, and keeps `activationApproved: false`.
Any future sealed staging must run the selected provider's actual state
migration and verify its output before activation can be considered. Text and
preference files are bound for preservation, not declared behavior-equivalent
merely because their paths and hashes are known.

This intake checkpoint does not complete usable project creation or authorize
server upgrade/map-import mutation. Genuine JAG decoding and canonical
conversion already have internal inventory-bound entrypoints; the production
project path still needs the complete selected Base visual/runtime projection.
The map-ID catalog alone is not render authority. In the currently pinned
provider, Base requires `db_name: current_base` while adaptive World Builder
requires `db_name: world_builder`; an explicit provider-owned Base authoring
state policy is needed before an actual project launch can satisfy both.
